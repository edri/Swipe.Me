# [Swipe.Me](https://github.com/edri/Swipe.Me)

## First note - Important
Because the website is still in sandbox mode, everybody cannot access it. If you *really* want to try it out, just send me an [email](mailto:miguel.santamaria@heig-vd.ch) and I'll be proud to give you an access. If you also have some feedbacks I'll be happy to read them!
The sandbox mode also have another big disadvantage: you cannot access any of the users' pictures but mine (which is not totally useless for me because I can get some free likes, hehe). To ensure you'll correctly find pictures, please enter one of the following hashtags: **#europe** (>= 18 available pictures), **#trip** (>= 11 pictures), **#valais** (>= 5 pictures), **#spain** (>= 1 picture(s)), ...

## Information

### What is Swipe.Me?
Swipe.Me is a Instagram non-official application, which allows you to swipe pictures to either reject or like them : left swipe to reject, right swipe to like!

### How to use it?
First thing first, you **must** have an Instagram account. If you still don't own one, just [click here](https://www.instagram.com/).  
Once done, nothing easier! Just go to the [website](http://swipe-me.herokuapp.com/), read the policy, and finally login with your Instagram account.  
You will then be redirected to the swiper page, in where you'll be able to search for a hashtag and swipe between pictures. First enter the hashtag you want to search in the input field (e.g. *"#foodporn"*, 'cause everybody likes food ; I could say *"#cat"*, too), and then just swipe between pictures by pressing either the "Reject" (or left-arrow key) or the "Like" (or right-arrow key) buttons. Isn't it beautiful?

I can see you going: *"Hey, how can I be sure you won't take all my data and sold them to everybody?"*. Well, that's an excellent question: first of all, it is written in the website's policy so you have my word ("Yeah, sure..."), then just feel free to check this repository to ensure I didn't hide some malicious code, and finally I just cannot access the user's password because of the connection process, which is provided and controlled by Instagram itself!

## Available pages
There is currently three available pages: the home page, the policy page, and finally the swiper one, which can be accessed only if you're connected.
