### Information

## What is Swipe.Me?
Swipe.Me is a Instagram non-official application, which allows you to swipe pictures to either reject or like them : left swipe to reject, right swipe to like!

## How to use it?
First thing first, you **must** have an Instagram account. If you still don't have one, just [click here](https://www.instagram.com/).  
Once done, nothing easier! Just go to the [website](http://swipe-me.herokuapp.com/), read the policy, and finally login with your Instagram account.  
You will then be redirected to the swiper page, in where you'll be able to search for a hashtag and swipe between pictures. First enter the hashtag you want to search in the input field, and then just swipe between pictures by pressing either the "Reject" (or left-arrow key) or the "Like" (or right-arrow key) buttons. Isn't it beautiful?

I can see you going: "Hey, how can I be sure you won't take all my data and sold them to everybody?". Well, that's an excellent question: this is written in the website's policy so you have my word (yeah, sure...), then just feel free to check this repository to ensure I didn't hide some malicious code, and finally I cannot access the user's password because of the connection process, which is provided and controlled by Instagram itself!
